# SenseConnect
Solo-designed smart connectivity solution — Tinkercad prototype, demo, and concept documentation.

Sense Connect is a solo-designed smart connectivity solution built in Tinkercad to demonstrate how everyday devices can communicate seamlessly for improved accessibility and convenience.

## About the Project
I independently designed the entire concept, created the 3D model in Tinkercad, and developed a working simulation to showcase the system's functionality. The prototype focuses on user-friendly interaction, adaptability, and real-world feasibility.

## Features
- 3D Tinkercad model for visual and functional demonstration
- Simulated connectivity flow for practical testing
- Designed for accessibility, ease of use, and smart integration
